atool - required for ranger archive extract 
unzip - required by atool to unzip archives 
flake8 - linter for vim-syntacticts , also support plugins 
pkgconf - required by autoreconf 
#installing deoplete(autocompletion) for vim8(needs neovim stuff) 
1.You need neovim or vim8 + python3 
2.if :echo has("python3") returns 1 means you have python3 
3.Install pip3 for python3. If you have it skip this 
python-pip - required to get python3 modules with pip3 for the auto complete tool in vim8 

4.Install neovim plugin for python3: 
pip3 install neovim 

5.Install nvim-yarp and make sure echo exepath('python3') points to python3 execut, if not then set it up with g:python3_host_prog 
6.Install vim-hug-neovim-rpc 
7.Test if importing neovim doesn't have error: 
python3 import neovim 
7.1 If you get PyExec error from greenlet reinstall it with: 
sudo pip3 install -U --force-reinstall --no-binary :all: greenlet 
8.Test if :echo neovim_rpc#serveraddr() prints 127.0.0.1:number 
9.Vim needs to have utf8 enabled 
10.Add following to vimrc and autocomplete should appear as you type
let g:deoplete#enable_at_startup = 1 

#Install universal ctags - that's what flake8 is required for 
You gotta built it with following commands: 
./autogen.sh 
./configure --prefix=/where/you/want # defaults to /usr/local 
make 
make install # may require extra privileges depending on where to install 
After build you can install Tagbar like a normal vim plugin 
There is also pylint besides flake8. Running both is nice but pylint has some redundant stuff and some better stuff than flake8. 
Both have pros and cons but flake8 is more solid 

#Changing system locale to utf8: Uncomment the language you want to add in. For english is en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8 
/etc/locale.gen 
Run locale-gen so it generates the new locale 
Now it should appear in locale -a 
Now edit the LANG env to LANG=en_US.UTF-8. 
You can do this by creating a ~/.config/locale.conf file with the LANG=en_US.UTF-8 in it. This way it will persist across logins 

 MAKE sure wpa_supplicant always current version(recommended if all the wpa configs are missing) 
 ----------------------------------------------- 
 ln -s /usr/share/dhcpcd/hooks/10-wpa_supplicant /usr/lib/dhcpcd/dhcpcd-hooks 
 Install wget and fping | required for openvpn ui  | DONT THINK YOU NEEDTHIS
 
 #firewall 
 Install ufw 
 ufw allow ssh | (a port will appear with ufw status verbose) 
 ufw allow from 192.168.0.0/24 
 ufw allow from 192.168.1.0/24 
 sudo ufw enable | to enable it | it uses iptables and ip6tables(disable their serivce if you have on cuz ufw will take care of it) 
 Install pptpclient | it said it worked not sure | DONT NEED THIS
 
 # OTHER 
 pacman.conf = uncomment [multilib] and below so you can install steam 
 
 ## Better wifi using wpa_supplicant manual way 
 1. Check if wpa_supplicant is running pgrep wpa_supplicant 
 2. If it is kill it with kill ID , where id are ones from pgrep
 3. Remove /var/lib/dhcpcd/*,lease to ensure you request a fresh ip
 4. Stop dhcpcd dhcdp -k systemctl stop dhcpcd killall dhcdpcd 
 5.Start connection with the below command
 sudo wpa_supplicant -dd -i wlp2s0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf 
 /where: -dd = debug 
              -i wlp2s0 = your interface 
               -c configpath 
               -D nl80211 = this is used by default 
               -B = fork to background. Daemonizing 
6.Request ip dhcpcd -d If doesn't work kill any running dhcpcd 
pgrep dhcpcd | killall dhcpcd doesn't always work 
7. To stop turn off dhcpcd 
dhcdp -k 

wpa_supplicant.conf example | quotes required: 
ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant/ 
network={ 
  ssid="NAME" 
  scan_ssid=1 
  psk="PASSWORD" 
} 
use wpa_passphrase "NAME" "PASSWORD" for encrypted output of psk. Copy that in the file 

### RECIPES 
""Service obliteration 
systemctl stop serviceName 
systemctl disable serviceName 
rm /etc/systemd/system/serviceName | symlinks 
systemctl daemon-reload 
systemctl reset-failed | gets rid of failed units 
Other directories:  /usr/lib/systemd/system/ 
                            /etc/init.d/serviceName | old style configuration
