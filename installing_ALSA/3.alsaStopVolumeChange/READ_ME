Overwrite those files in the below path:

/usr/share/pulseaudio/alsa-mixer/paths

Will set alsamixer values to:
Capture:40
Mic boost:20
Mic internal:0

Other values should be set to 0 from sudo alsamixer:
Digital
Also I set PCM to 100

Do an sudo alsactl store to be sure it stores the info

This should prevent the input mic volume from changing.
# You need to manually select the echo cancel input in case it doesn't autoselect. It won't break anything

# Don't change the input volume even though it shows 100 or something else, that's not the real one.It respects the alsa settings
