Copy that file in:
/etc/pulse

Make the folder if not exists also delete anything in /home/redsigma/.config/pulse if any exists

After i installed pulseaudio i got an error and adding the defaults file there fixed the problem.
If the echoInput doesn't get autoselected you can still select it manually as it won't break.
